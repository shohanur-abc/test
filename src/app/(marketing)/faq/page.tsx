We implement role-based access control (RBAC) so that each user — teacher, parent, admin — only sees the data they\'re authorized to access.

School administrators can create custom roles — for example, a "Class Teacher" role that can only see their assigned students, or a "Fee Clerk" role limited to financial data.
